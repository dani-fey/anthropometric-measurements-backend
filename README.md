# Anthropometric measurements

This is a backend provider for the [Anthropometric Measurements SPA](https://github.com/dani-fey/anthropometric-measurements-react).
Originally forked from [the original Anthropometric Measurements repository](https://github.com/ad-freiburg/anthropometric-measurements) - which powers the web app https://anthro.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

It provides means for an intuitive visualization of detailed anthropometric
measurements of 2208 women and 1774 men (from the 1988 US ANSUR study).
